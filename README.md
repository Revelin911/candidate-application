# Candidate Application

## Description

This is an app where you can search for users through Github. The reason behind this app is to help facilitate in the organization of available candidates and potential candidates. This will help employers keep better track of candidates and view their profiles in an efficient manner. The employer will be able to save the candidates they are interested in or not. This project helped practice how to work with the front end using Github's user information. I needed to practice making correct calls to search for users accordingly. It was good practice using a UI that already has data and saving it locally.
